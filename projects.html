                    Social e-commerce sites can acquire millions of users within a short
                    time and are growing fast at an accelerated rate. In this paper, we
                    demonstrate how these social commerce platforms develop as a blend
                    of social relationships and economic transactions. We present the
                    first measurement study on the full-scale data of Beidian, one of
                    the fastest-growing social e-commerce sites in China, which involves
                    11.8 million users. We first analyze the topological structure of
                    the Beidian platform and highlight its decentralized nature. We then
                    study the site’s rapid growth and its growth mechanism via
                    invitation cascade. Finally, we investigate the purchasing network
                    on Beidian, where we focus on user proximity and loyalty, which
                    contributes to the site’s high conversion rate. As the consequences
                    of interactions between strong ties and economic logic, emerging
                    social commerce demonstrates significant property deviations from
                    all known social networks and e-commerce in terms of network
                    structure, dynamics, and user behavior. To the best of our
                    knowledge, this work is the first quantitative study on the network
                    characteristics and dynamics of emerging social commerce platforms.

                    Social e-commerce platforms embed shopping experiences within IM
                    apps, e.g., WeChat, where real-world friends post and recommend
                    products from the platform in IM group chats and quite often form
                    lasting recommending/buying relationships. How and why do users
                    engage in IM based social commerce? Do such platforms create novel
                    experiences that are distinct from prior commerce? And do these
                    platforms bring changes to user social lives and relationships? To
                    shed light on these questions, we launch a qualitative study where
                    we carry out 12 semi-structured interviews. We show that IM based
                    social commerce: 1) enables more reachable, cost-reducing, and
                    ubiquitous user shopping experiences, 2) shapes user decision-making
                    process in shopping through pre-existing social relationship, mutual
                    trust, shared identity, and community norm, and 3) creates novel
                    social interactions, which can contribute to new tie formation while
                    maintaining existing social relationships. We demonstrate that all
                    these unique aspects link closely to the characteristics of IM
                    platforms, as well as the coupling of user social and economic lives
                    under such a business model. Our study provides important research

                    trusted socio-technical systems in general.

                <p>
                    Social e-commerce platforms leverage the stimulated word-of-mouth
                    effect to promote the sales of items. In this paper, we investigate
                    how people’s purchase behaviors are shaped in this scenario on a
                    full-scale purchase behavior dataset from one of the leading social
                    e-commerce platforms, Beidian. Specifically, we conduct a comparison
                    study between social e-commerce and conventional e-commerce to
                    examine how social factors affect user’s purchase behaviors. We
                    reveal that social e-commerce leads to a 3.09∼10.37 times higher
                    purchase conversion rate than the conventional settings, where users
                    make purchases with significantly fewer item explorations. We
                    propose and validate four primary mechanisms that contribute to the
                    efficient purchase conversion: better matching, social enrichment,
                    social proof, and price sensitivity. We identify several behavioral
                    indicators that can measure these mechanisms’ effectiveness, based
                    on which we design an accurate predictive model (AUC=0.7738) for
                    user’s purchase decisions. These results combine to shed light on
                    how to understand and model the purchase behavior in social
                    e-commerce.

                </h3>
                <p>
                    On social e-commerce, agents are a key group of actors who enable
                    market transactions. Social e-commerce transforms users into agents
                    by motivating them with monetary rewards to promote products and
                    invite new agents through their social network. Despite their rapid
                    growth, there is still inadequate evidence on how such agent
                    invitation works. This research examines what factors affect the
                    agent invitation process. We first conduct a qualitative user study,
                    where we identify four potential mechanisms affecting agent
                    invitation: social conformity, social enrichment, refusal avoidance,
                    and benefit-cost trade-off. Leveraging the empirical data collected
                    from one of the largest social e-commerce platforms – Beidian, we
                    operationalize a set of behavioral indicators of these mechanisms
                    and further develop machine learning models to predict users’
                    reactions to invitations. We find that the identified four
                    mechanisms contribute to the high success rate of agent invitations
                    differently. We conclude by discussing the implications of our
                    findings and their potential benefits to real-world applications.

                <p>
                    On social e-commerce, agents act as intermediaries who connect producers with consumers by sharing
                    information with and recommending products to their real-world social contacts. Despite their
                    crucial role, the nature and behavior of these intermediaries on these social e-commerce platforms
                    has not been systematically analyzed. Here we address this knowledge gap through a mixed-method
                    study. Leveraging nine months’ all-round behavior of about 40 million users on Beidian – one of the
                    largest social e-commerce sites in China, alongside with qualitative evidence from online forums and
                    interviews, we examine characteristics of intermediaries, identify their behavioral patterns, and
                    uncover strategies and mechanisms that make successful intermediaries. We demonstrate that
                    intermediaries on social e-commerce sites act as local trend detectors and “social grocers”.
                    Furthermore, successful intermediaries are highly dedicated whenever best sellers appear and broaden
                    items for promotion. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first large-scale
                    analysis on the emerging role of intermediaries in social e-commerce platforms, which provides
                    potential insights for the design and management of social computing marketing platforms.

                <p>
                    Social e-commerce transforms a social community into an inclusive place to do business by enabling
                    people to share products with their friends. We define this task of generating sharing suggestions
                    as item recommendation for the word-of-mouth scenario, and to the best of our knowledge, this is a
                    new task that has never been explored. In this paper, we propose a TriM (short for Triad based
                    word-of-Mouth recommendation) model that can capture both the sharer’s influence and the receiver’s
                    interest at the same time, which are two significant factors that determine whether the receiver
                    will buy the product or not. Furthermore, with joint learning on two parts of interaction data to
                    address the data sparsity issue, our proposed TriM-Joint further improves the recommendation
                    performance. By conducting experiments, we show that our proposed models achieve the best results
                    compared to state-of-the-art models with significant improvements by at least 7.4% ∼ 14.4%,
                    respectively.

                <p>
                    Existing social recommendation methods violate the fact that users are likely to share preference on
                    different products with different friends: friends’ behaviors do not necessarily affect a user’s
                    preferences, and the influence is diverse among different items. In this paper, we contribute a new
                    solution, CSR (short for Characterized Social Regularization) model by designing a universal
                    regularization term for modeling variable social influence. This regularization term captures the
                    finely grained similarity of social-connected friends. We further introduce two variants of our
                    model with different optimization manners. Our proposed model can be applied to both explicit and
                    implicit interaction due to its high generality. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets
                    demonstrate that our CSR significantly outperforms state-of-the-art social recommendation methods.
                    Further experiments show that CSR can improve recommendation performance for those users with sparse
                    social relations or behavioral interactions.

                <p>
                    On social e-commerce, there are numerous types of relations between three types of nodes, i.e.,
                    users, selling agents and items. The complex interactions in this type of social e-commerce can be
                    formulated as Heterogeneous Information Networks (HIN). Although Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs)
                    have recently been established as the latest state-of-the-art methods in representation learning,
                    prior GCN models have fundamental limitations in both modeling heterogeneous relations and
                    efficiently sampling relevant receptive field from vast neighborhood. To address these problems, we
                    propose RecoGCN, which stands for a RElation-aware CO-attentive GCN model, to effectively aggregate
                    heterogeneous features in a HIN. It makes up current GCN’s limitation in modeling heterogeneous
                    relations with a relation-aware aggregator, and leverages the semantic-aware meta-paths to carve out
                    concise and relevant receptive fields for each node. To effectively fuse the embeddings learned from
                    different meta-paths, we further develop a co-attentive mechanism to dynamically assign importance
                    weights to different meta-paths by attending the three-way interactions among users, selling agents
                    and items. Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate RecoGCN can learn meaningful
                    node embeddings in HIN, and consistently outperforms baseline methods in recommendation tasks.

                            Recommendation for Social E-Commerce</i></span></h3>

                <p>
                    In this paper, we address the problem of cross-platform recommendation for social e-commerce, i.e.,
                    recommending products to users when they are shopping through social media. Existing cross-platform
                    and social-related recommendation methods cannot be applied directly for this problem since they do
                    not co-consider the social information and the cross-platform characteristics together. To study
                    this problem, we first investigate the heterogeneous shopping behaviors between traditional
                    e-commerce app and social media. Based on these observations from data, we propose CROSS
                    (Cross-platform Recommendation for Online Shopping in Social Media), a recommendation model
                    utilizing not only user-item interaction data on both platforms, but also social relation data on
                    social media. Extensive experiments on real-world online shopping dataset demonstrate that our
                    proposed CROSS significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

                <h3>Group-buying Scenario <span>ICDE 2021</span><br /><span><i>Group-Buying Recommendation for Social
                            E-Commerce</i></span></h3>
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Group buying, as an emerging form of purchase in social e-commerce websites, has recently achieved
                    great success. Group-buying recommendation for social e-commerce, which recommends an item list when
                    users want to launch a group, plays an important role in the group success ratio and sales. However,
                    designing a personalized recommendation model for group buying is an entirely new problem that is
                    seldom explored. In this work, we take the first step to approach the problem of group-buying
                    recommendation for social e-commerce and develop a GBGCN method (short for Group-Buying Graph
                    Convolutional Network). Considering the multiple types of behaviors and structured social network
                    data, we first propose to construct directed heterogeneous graphs to represent behavioral data and
                    social networks. We then develop a graph convolutional network model with multi-view embedding
                    propagation, which can extract the complicated high-order graph structure to learn the embeddings.
                    Last, since a failed group-buying implies rich preferences of the initiator and participants, we
                    design a double-pairwise loss function to distill such preference signals. We collect a real-world
                    dataset of group-buying and conduct experiments to evaluate the performance. Empirical results
                    demonstrate that our proposed GBGCN can significantly outperform baseline methods by 2.69%-7.36%.
